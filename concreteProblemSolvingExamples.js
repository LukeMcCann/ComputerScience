// Concrete Examples
//
// First we understand the problem
// we covered this in the early section.
// Once we have a good understanding of our
// problem, have asked the right questions,
// and gathered all the information we can
// to assist in our problem solving, 
// we can then explore some more
// concrete examples.
//
// Coming up with concrete examples will not
// only help you in understanding the problem
// better, but also provide sanity checks, ensuring
// your eventual solution works as it should. 
//
// By creating these examples we can also
// uncover more information, these are known
// as user stories in development cycles. 
//
// If we are conducting TDD we may even conduct
// these as unit tests, or in BDD our class spec. 
//
// When exploring examples:
//          1. Start Simple
//              - Start with the most basic examples with an input and an output
//          2. Progress to more complex examples
//          3. Explore edge cases (e.g. examples with empty and invalid inputs)
